<h2> Educational Goals </h2>
<ul>
	<li>I plan to gain as much knowledge as I can about the various popular coding languages through the courses here at cerritos.</li>
	<li>I want to get as many languages under my belt as possible so that I'm well prepared for a career once I get my degree.</li>
	<li>I Hope to network with other similarly minded people to start a chain of support for some future coders once we all head out into the world in search of opportunity.</li>
</ul>

	<h3>Skills</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>Natural born leader, I tend to gravitate towards being an organizer and planner when faced with group work or projects.</li>
	<li>I like to think that I am a decent speaker, at least to smaller groups of people, and I try to get along with everyone on a team so that working together is more relaxed and friendly.</li>
	<li>I read quite efficiently, which helps me comprehend some topics faster and allows me to be a little more creative with the knowledge I've gathered.</li>
</ol>
