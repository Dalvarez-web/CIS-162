	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>My name is Damian and I am a Programming major here at Cerritos.
	I am 20 years old and hoping to start my career in coding soon with the help of this class and others like it.
	My college goal is to earn my Associate's Degree in Programming so that I can get my foot into the door of the industry and see where I can go from there.
	For fun you'll usually find me gaming, reading, watching YouTube, or listening to music. I have a very small amount of experience with HTML from back in high school but it's been long enough that I don't mind starting fresh in this class.
	My goals for this course are to gather as much knowledge as I can in order to help me code more proficiently in the future.
	This is the first project of the class so wish me luck with this HTML stuff!
